# Music Classification Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project classifies classical music compositions by six renowned composers using machine learning techniques. By extracting features from MIDI files, such as pitch histograms, average note durations, and key signatures, we trained various machine learning models to predict the composer of a given composition.

## Features Extracted
- **Pitch Histograms**: Frequency of pitch occurrences across 12 semitones.
- **Average Note Duration**: Captures the typical length of notes in a composition.
- **Key Signatures**: Analyzes the tonic and mode of each piece.
- **Number of Chords**: Indicates harmonic complexity.
- **Melodic Intervals**: Identifies pitch changes to understand stylistic differences.

## Machine Learning Models Used
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
- Logistic Regression
- k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
- Voting Ensemble
- Stacked Ensemble

## Results
The models achieved varying levels of accuracy. The best-performing models were:
- **Random Forest**: 92.19% accuracy
- **Stacked Ensemble**: 92.05% accuracy

Other models like Gradient Boosting and Voting Ensemble also performed well, with accuracy rates above 88%.

## Challenges Faced
- **Feature Extraction**: This step was the most time-consuming, taking around 4â€“5 hours due to various challenges like parsing errors and inconsistencies in MIDI file formats. Multiple iterations were needed to ensure accurate feature extraction.
- **Model Training and Tuning**: Hyperparameter tuning, especially for MLP and SVM models, was computationally expensive and required significant experimentation.
